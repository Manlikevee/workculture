<div class="blogpostdetail">
  <div class="abtdivs">
    <div class="abtdiv">At Work Culture, we are driven by the desire to see professional HR best practice as a way of life in organizational dynamics ultimately for short and long term benefits in productivity, resource efficiency, business space leadership, profitability, brand respect, corporate responsibility.</div>
  <div class="abtdiv">
   <b>Compensation and Total Rewards:</b> It is key to have a compensation framework that works for your business and your industry. Until you get that right one of your major challenges will remain attrition and turnover of your employees. Structure and organization in your employee compensation arrangements may be one of the most rewarding HR strategies ever. A compensation philosophy and framework can help you achieve this and where properly executed will see you retain your best hands for longer.
  </div>  
  <div class="abtdiv">
    <b>Performance Management: </b>Many Small Businesses do not have effective performance Management structures. When conversations on performance are brought to the fore, the responses are often vague and subjective. Knowing how to set clear expectations, providing the tools that enable performance and being able to measure outcomes along clear parameters is essential to achieving returns on investment on your employee costs
   </div>  

   <div class="abtdiv">
    Regulatory Knowledge: Blocking gaps and stemming leakages which can surface in the guise of fines and penalties can hemorrhage whatever profits your business makes. Knowledge of Regulatory obligations regarding taxes, pensions, health insurance, accident and life insurance for your employees can make the difference not only for walking the right side of the law but also for differentiating you as a responsible employer.

  
   </div>
   
   <div class="abtdiv">
    <b>Talent Acquisition:</b>  The importance of picking the right person for your vacant roles cannot be over emphasized. There are technical know how's that can be adopted to ensure you are recruiting capable hands and fitting square pegs into square holes. Recruitment errors can prove to be extremely costly and frustrating. It is best avoided.
  </div>

  <div class="abtdiv"><b>Business Partnering:</b> Where the HRM understands the challenge and the frustrations of the Business, its easier to find the fine balance between cost, innovation, problem solving that resolves challenges in a win-win situation for all. Every other competency can be harnessed properly at the business partners door where deliberate effort is made to take a 360 degree view of all possibilities available to help the business grow by harnessing the resources and maximizing for productive output.</div>

  
  <div class="abtdiv"><b>Communication Skills:</b> What to say, When to say it and How to say it are key factors in communication. It is important that the objective and the motive behind passing information along is clearly established. Wrong choice in words, wrong tone, wrong medium could cause chaos and speculations within your organization which may in turn elicit reactions that are contrary to your organisations’ interests. Sometimes, it may be in not communicating at all or communicating too much or even not leaving room for questions and feedback from staff. Anchoring communication with the required expertise makes a tangible difference in the disposition and attitude to work.</div>

   
  <div class="abtdiv">As base as some of these competencies may appear, understanding and executing them may be the lifesaver your business needs. Even if you have someone handling your Human Resource Management, as a business owner, understanding the implications helps you better understand propositions made by your HRM. It is a typical assumption that HRM is cost centered. This is a wrong assumption and tapping into this truth makes the difference.
    While there are many more competencies that can be reviewed, these 6 give a good head start to getting things right.
    Good luck!</div>
